# Attest Proof Bundle: roman-to-numeral

**Verdict: ERROR**  
Run `roman-to-numeral-attest-a1-20261017T171647930067Z` · profile `eval-attest-a1` · provider `nebius_tokenfactory` · executor `tf_sandboxes`  
Started 2026-10-17T17:16:47.931658+00:00, finished 2026-10-17T17:17:17.199937+00:00.

**This run did not complete.** The sandbox executor failed at stage seal. The outcome of the failing call was uncertain, so Attest did not retry it and certified nothing. The repository was not changed by this run.

Key evidence (E7): sandbox executor error after 2 model call(s): SandboxError: spawn outcome uncertain (URLError: <urlopen error [SSL: UNEXPECTED_EOF_WHILE_READING] EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:1000)>); inspect account operations, do not replay



What to do: Start a new run. This failure is infrastructure, not a judgement about the task.

Reasons: SandboxError: spawn outcome uncertain (URLError: <urlopen error [SSL: UNEXPECTED_EOF_WHILE_READING] EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:1000)>); inspect account operations, do not replay


## 0. What this bundle proves, and what it does not
Generated from the recorded gates; each statement cites the exhibit that carries it.

Proves:
- The run failed in the sandbox executor at stage seal; nothing was retried (E7).

Does not prove:
- Anything about mutation resistance: the mutation check did not run (E2).
- Anything from tests written after the patch: that stage did not run (E3).
- Anything beyond the model-written tests and the repository's own suite: no held-out suite was configured for this task (E4).
- That the sealed tests capture the requester's intent: they were written by a model from the task statement, so a VERIFIED patch is correct against those tests, not against unstated requirements (E1).
- That the patch is correct for inputs none of the suites exercise.
- Anything about the patch or the task: no verdict about the candidate was reached (E7).

Upstream: none (task authored for this project, not taken from an external repository).

The roman package exposes is_roman_numeral (already implemented) and a stub to_roman(n). Implement to_roman(n) so that it converts an integer n in the range 1..3999 inclusive to its standard Roman numeral string using subtractive notation (4='IV', 9='IX', 40='XL', 90='XC', 400='CD', 900='CM'). Return a str. Raise ValueError when n is an int outside 1..3999. Raise TypeError when n is not an int (for example '5', 5.0, None, [1]); numeric strings and integral floats are not coerced. Type discipline is by value: an instance of an int subclass (for example an IntEnum member or `class PlainInt(int)`) is accepted and converted exactly like the int with the same value, including the range check. Int subclasses that override arithmetic or comparison operators are out of scope: their behaviour is unspecified and tests must not depend on it. bool is a subclass of int; rejecting True and False with TypeError is permitted but not required, and tests must not depend on either choice. Do not change is_roman_numeral or the tests.

## 2. Specification and contract
Feasible: True. Implement the to_roman(n) function in the roman package to convert an integer n in the range 1..3999 inclusive to its standard Roman numeral string using subtractive notation. The function must raise ValueError for integers outside the range and TypeError for non-integer inputs (including numeric strings, floats, None, lists). Instances of int subclasses (e.g., IntEnum, PlainInt) are accepted and treated as their integer value, including range check. The behavior for bool (True/False) is unspecified; rejecting them with TypeError is permitted but not required. The existing is_roman_numeral function and tests must not be changed.

| Name | Signature | Behavior | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| to_roman | to_roman(n: int) -> str | Converts an integer n in the range 1..3999 inclusive to its standard Roman numeral string using subtractive notation (e.g., 4='IV', 9='IX', 40='XL', 90='XC', 40 | ValueError: raised when n is an int (or int subclass instance) with value outside 1..3999 (e.g., 0, -1, 4000).; TypeError: raised when n is not an int (or int s |

Acceptance criteria:
1. to_roman(1) returns 'I'
2. to_roman(4) returns 'IV'
3. to_roman(9) returns 'IX'
4. to_roman(40) returns 'XL'
5. to_roman(90) returns 'XC'
6. to_roman(400) returns 'CD'
7. to_roman(900) returns 'CM'
8. to_roman(2024) returns 'MMXXIV'
9. to_roman(3999) returns 'MMMCMXCIX'
10. to_roman(1994) returns 'MCMXCIV'
11. to_roman returns a str for all valid inputs.
12. ValueError is raised for ints outside 1..3999 (e.g., 0, -1, 4000), including int subclass instances with such values.
13. TypeError is raised for non-int input (e.g., '5', 5.0, None, [1]).
14. An int subclass instance with a value in range (e.g., PlainInt(49)) converts like the equal int: PlainInt(49) -> 'XLIX'.
15. The function does not modify the existing is_roman_numeral function.
16. The function does not change the existing tests.

## 3. E1 Sealed tests (written before implementation by an independent model instance)
`None` sha256 `None`, 0 test methods, sealed at None by `None`; attempts: 0.

Red check on the unmodified checkpoint (one child process per test under the supervisor): n/a: 0 of 0 methods failing, 0 passing; operation `None`.

(none)

## 4. Candidate patch
0 changed path(s); scope check not run; 0 implementer turn(s).

```diff
(no changes)
```




## 5. Fresh-branch verification (E1 binding; E4 held-out)
Order: sealed supervisor and existing suite in one branch (bundle predates the order rule).

Sealed suite: n/a. Operation `None`, networking disabled, disposable branch from the checkpoint; the supervisor is the first step and runs two verifier canaries after the suite.

(none)

Existing suite (evidence class `stdout`): n/a (0 passed of 0); operation `None`; parsed from console output ().

E4 held-out suite: none configured.

## 6. Gates and verdict rule
Evidence classes: `bound` = per-test exit codes under the supervisor, nonce and digests checked; `stdout` = parsed console output of the repository's test command; `model` = a model judgement. Skipped gates never count as passed.

(none)

Verdict rule: VERIFIED only when every gate holds; any failed gate yields NEEDS HUMAN with the exact reasons (derivation not recorded; bundle predates M2).

## 7. Breaker pass (E2 mutation check; E3 tests written after the patch)
E2: mutation pass not run (verification did not pass).

(none)

E3: model-written adversarial tests: not run.



### Counterexamples
None: no sealed, adversarial or held-out test failed on the candidate.

## 8. E5 Drift audit
Drift audit not run.



## 8b. E6 Arbitration of generated-test failures
Not run (the verdict was not a generated-test NEEDS HUMAN, or arbitration was disabled).





## 9. Grounding
No grounding calls (specification named no external references).

## 11. Limitations of this bundle
- Profile 'eval-attest-a1': inference provider nebius_tokenfactory; submission runs must use NVIDIA Nemotron on Nebius Token Factory and are labeled separately.
- Sealed and adversarial suites run one child process per test under a supervisor that never imports candidate code and is the first step of its branch; two verifier canaries detect blanket result forgery. A candidate can still forge its own result from inside a child after the nonce was read if it spares the canaries (the mutation gate and held-out tests are the structural detectors).
- The repository's own suite and the held-out suite run after the sealed verification in their own branches. They are bound through the same supervisor only for unittest repositories whose tests are statically discoverable; otherwise they are parsed from console output and the gate is labelled evidence_class 'stdout'.
- Model-written sealed and adversarial tests can be wrong; their failures block VERIFIED. An independent arbiter then classifies each failure (implementation bug, test defect or contract dispute) and, for pure test defects, corrects and re-verifies them (must pass on the candidate and still fail on the base). Arbitration is advisory by default and never clears an implementation bug or a contract dispute; it changes the verdict only in explicit apply mode.
- Grounding runs only when the specification names external references; sources are cited, not verified for correctness.
- Sandbox CPU/RAM quota controls were not found in the current public REST API; per operation only max_layer_bytes, a timeout and the networking flag are set.
- Sandbox raw 'cost' diagnostics are not USD; Codex gateway usage is ChatGPT allowance, not a Nebius charge; Nebius USD is computed from the public price table, not an invoice.
- Each run retains one checkpoint image on the service; no image-delete control was found in the current public REST API.
- manifest.json lists the sha256 of every artifact and `python -m attest check <run dir or zip>` recomputes digests, the sealed and adversarial bindings from verify_raw.json and the gate-to-verdict rule offline; it cannot re-execute the sandbox runs themselves.

## 12. E7 Failure record
Component: sandbox executor; stage: seal; model calls 2 (0 failed); sandbox operations 2; committed cost USD 0.008862; uncertain unpriced calls 0; retried: no; outcome uncertain: yes.

- SandboxError: spawn outcome uncertain (URLError: <urlopen error [SSL: UNEXPECTED_EOF_WHILE_READING] EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:1000)>); inspect account operations, do not replay

## 13. Artifacts
Every file of the run directory is listed in `manifest.json` with its sha256 and size (written last, so it covers this file and proof_bundle.json). `python -m attest check <run dir or zip>` recomputes the digests, the sealed and adversarial bindings from `verify_raw.json`, the ledger totals and the gate-to-verdict rule, and re-renders this document.
