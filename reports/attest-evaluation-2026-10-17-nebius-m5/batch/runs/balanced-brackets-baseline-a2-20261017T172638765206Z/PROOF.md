**Verdict: BASELINE**

Started 2026-10-17T17:26:38.765406+00:00, finished 2026-10-17T17:27:18.869575+00:00.

**Baseline run: no verification.** This run belongs to the evaluation's plain-agent arm: the implementer worked without sealed tests, breaker or audit, and the candidate was judged only by the harness. It certifies nothing.

Key evidence (trajectory): candidate produced for the independent judge; no gates recorded



What to do: Compare with the Attest run of the same task in the evaluation report.

Reasons: all gates passed


## 0. What this bundle proves, and what it does not
Generated from the recorded gates; each statement cites the exhibit that carries it.

Proves:
- nothing: no gate was reached

Does not prove:
- Anything about mutation resistance: the mutation check did not run (E2).
- Anything from tests written after the patch: that stage did not run (E3).
- Anything beyond the model-written tests and the repository's own suite: no held-out suite was configured for this task (E4).
- That the sealed tests capture the requester's intent: they were written by a model from the task statement, so a VERIFIED patch is correct against those tests, not against unstated requirements (E1).
- That the patch is correct for inputs none of the suites exercise.
- Anything about a candidate patch: none was verified in this run.

| E3 | Tests written after the patch | not run | bound | not reached |

## 1. Frozen task and provenance
Task `balanced-brackets`, spec digest `84a644df71119f779e1a38d10248660efd901acec94c0ee01ed3d5db79c00f01`; base image `python:3.12-slim` (uuid `4fa16c8f-62a9-35a4-a4ea-07b7e8cd44ae`), checkpoint `96ff8a5e-fbcf-4eab-b9dc-9eac9cd4497e`; test runner `unittest`; install: `none` (checkpoint networking off).

Attest 0.3.0 revision `166cdcbd46a74cd0` (35 package sources; no git repository). Guest programs: supervisor `attest-sealed-supervisor/6` sha256 `93e8c9edacca93fc`, per-test child `e4e7b0b294a2004c`, canary module `9cdc57c1348fae5c`, sandbox runner `80999537285bacaf`.
Runtime: Python 3.12.0 on macOS-27.0.1-arm64-arm-64bit; package executed from `/work/attest/reports/attest-evaluation-2026-10-17-nebius-m5/batch/snapshot/attest`.

Sampling (nebius_tokenfactory): temperature 0.2, max_tokens 16000; spec: nvidia/Nemotron-3-Ultra-550b-a55b; seal: nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b; implement: nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b; break: nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b; audit: nvidia/Nemotron-3-Ultra-550b-a55b; arbitrate: nvidia/Nemotron-3-Ultra-550b-a55b; summary: nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning.

Limits: max_turns 14, max_mutants 12, mutation_threshold 0.5, drift_threshold 0.6, mutant_workers 8, max_seal_attempts 3, min_sealed_tests 5, min_mutants_for_score 4, min_adversarial_when_no_mutants 6, per_test_timeout_s 60, test_timeout_s 180, checkpoint_timeout_s 300, arbitrate False, arbitration_apply False.

Upstream: none (task authored for this project, not taken from an external repository).

The brackets package exposes is_bracket (already implemented) and a stub is_balanced(s). Implement is_balanced(s) so that it returns True when the three kinds of brackets (), [] and {} in the string s are correctly matched and nested, and False otherwise. Characters that are not brackets are ignored. The empty string is balanced. is_balanced must return a bool. Raise TypeError when s is not a string. Do not change is_bracket or the tests.

## 2. Specification and contract
Feasible: True. The brackets package exposes is_bracket (already implemented) and a stub is_balanced(s). Implement is_balanced(s) so that it returns True when the three kinds of brackets (), [] and {} in the string s are correctly matched and nested, and False otherwise. Characters that are not brackets are ignored. The empty string is balanced. is_balanced must return a bool. Raise TypeError when s is not a string. Do not change is_bracket or the tests.

(none)

Acceptance criteria:
1. '', '()', '[]', '{}', '()[]{}', '([{}])' are all balanced (True)
2. nested mixed brackets with other characters are balanced: '(a[b]{c})', 'f(x[0], y[1])'
3. '(', ')', '([)]', '(]', '{[}', '())' are not balanced (False)
4. non-bracket characters are ignored
5. is_balanced returns a bool
6. TypeError when s is not a string

## 3. E1 Sealed tests (written before implementation by an independent model instance)
`None` sha256 `None`, 0 test methods, sealed at None by `None`; attempts: 0.

Red check on the unmodified checkpoint (one child process per test under the supervisor): n/a: 0 of 0 methods failing, 0 passing; operation `None`.

(none)

## 4. Candidate patch
1 changed path(s); scope check passed; 7 implementer turn(s).

## 5. Fresh-branch verification (E1 binding; E4 held-out)
Order: sealed supervisor and existing suite in one branch (bundle predates the order rule).

Sealed suite: n/a. Operation `None`, networking disabled, disposable branch from the checkpoint; the supervisor is the first step and runs two verifier canaries after the suite.

(none)

Existing suite (evidence class `stdout`): n/a (0 passed of 0); operation `None`; parsed from console output ().

E4 held-out suite: none configured.

## 6. Gates and verdict rule
Evidence classes: `bound` = per-test exit codes under the supervisor, nonce and digests checked; `stdout` = parsed console output of the repository's test command; `model` = a model judgement. Skipped gates never count as passed.

(none)

Verdict rule: VERIFIED only when every gate holds; any failed gate yields NEEDS HUMAN with the exact reasons (derivation not recorded; bundle predates M2).

## 7. Breaker pass (E2 mutation check; E3 tests written after the patch)
E2: mutation pass not run (verification did not pass).

(none)

E3: model-written adversarial tests: not run.



### Counterexamples
None: no sealed, adversarial or held-out test failed on the candidate.

## 8. E5 Drift audit
Drift audit not run.



## 8b. E6 Arbitration of generated-test failures
Not run (the verdict was not a generated-test NEEDS HUMAN, or arbitration was disabled).





## 9. Grounding
Grounding not configured.

## 11. Limitations of this bundle
- Profile 'eval-baseline-a2': inference provider nebius_tokenfactory; submission runs must use NVIDIA Nemotron on Nebius Token Factory and are labeled separately.
- Sealed and adversarial suites run one child process per test under a supervisor that never imports candidate code and is the first step of its branch; two verifier canaries detect blanket result forgery. A candidate can still forge its own result from inside a child after the nonce was read if it spares the canaries (the mutation gate and held-out tests are the structural detectors).
- The repository's own suite and the held-out suite run after the sealed verification in their own branches. They are bound through the same supervisor only for unittest repositories whose tests are statically discoverable; otherwise they are parsed from console output and the gate is labelled evidence_class 'stdout'.
- Model-written sealed and adversarial tests can be wrong; their failures block VERIFIED. An independent arbiter then classifies each failure (implementation bug, test defect or contract dispute) and, for pure test defects, corrects and re-verifies them (must pass on the candidate and still fail on the base). Arbitration is advisory by default and never clears an implementation bug or a contract dispute; it changes the verdict only in explicit apply mode.
- Grounding runs only when the specification names external references; sources are cited, not verified for correctness.
- Sandbox CPU/RAM quota controls were not found in the current public REST API; per operation only max_layer_bytes, a timeout and the networking flag are set.
- Sandbox raw 'cost' diagnostics are not USD; Codex gateway usage is ChatGPT allowance, not a Nebius charge; Nebius USD is computed from the public price table, not an invoice.
- Each run retains one checkpoint image on the service; no image-delete control was found in the current public REST API.
- manifest.json lists the sha256 of every artifact and `python -m attest check <run dir or zip>` recomputes digests, the sealed and adversarial bindings from verify_raw.json and the gate-to-verdict rule offline; it cannot re-execute the sandbox runs themselves.

## 13. Artifacts
Every file of the run directory is listed in `manifest.json` with its sha256 and size (written last, so it covers this file and proof_bundle.json). `python -m attest check <run dir or zip>` recomputes the digests, the sealed and adversarial bindings from `verify_raw.json`, the ledger totals and the gate-to-verdict rule, and re-renders this document.
